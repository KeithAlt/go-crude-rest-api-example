# Crude REST API Products API
This repository is intended to serve as an example for the curious minded of how you could structure a Go REST API.

This API is a **work in progress** & I will be adding the following features below as I'm able:
- [ ] envvar for secret management
- [ ] Hashicorp Vault for secret management
- [ ] LetsEncrypt for SSL
- [ ] Dockerfiles for deployment
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Dependency injection
- [ ] Kafka for events messaging
- [ ] Swagger for docs
