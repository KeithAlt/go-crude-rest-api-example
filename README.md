# Crude REST API Products API
This repository is intended to serve as an example for the curious minded of how you could structure a Go REST API.
The end-product goal of this repository is to serve as a design example capable of enterprise-level enviornments.

This API is a **work in progress** & I will be adding the following features below as I'm able:
- [ ] Fully flushed out project structure
- [ ] Polished & tested service/routes 
- [ ] envvar for environment variables
- [ ] Hashicorp Vault for secret management
- [ ] LetsEncrypt for SSL
- [ ] Dockerfiles for deployment
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Dependency injection
- [ ] Kafka for events messaging
- [ ] Swagger for docs
